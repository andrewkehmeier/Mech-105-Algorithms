# Linear Regression Algorithm

## Inputs:
x = vector of independent variable values
y = vector of corresponding dependent variable values

### Outputs:
m = slope of best fit line
y0 = y-intercept of best fit line

### Notes:
1. Vector inputs must be of same dimension
2. Slope of best fit line found using normal equations
